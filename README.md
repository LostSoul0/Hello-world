Hey there, according to [this site](https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-many-coding-languages-are-there/#:~:text=How%20Many%20Computer%20Languages%20Are,languages%2C%20including%20esoteric%20coding%20languages) there are over 800 programming languages in the world,
and I'm sure that they all have an option to print `Hello world!` as every language does, **duh**.

So I made this repo! Let's see in how many languages we can say `Hello world!`.

Please share your code, how to do so in the comments, and also the command on how to run that file if possible. Thanks!
